# LightningNetwork Network

Owned by the community of LN supporters, who created a network of active members working to promote and finalise world-wide adoption. They call themselves the LightningNetwork Network. Their creation: The LightningNetwork Foundation (who immediately renamed itself to LightningNetwork Network) not to be confused with the original genesis group: the LightningNetwork Network.

## Badges

Badges show your commitment and lightning network adoption zeal.  The point is to show the smaller subset of LN enthusiasts that "you are onboard" or on your way to being onboard to have your clients use LN on your platform.
